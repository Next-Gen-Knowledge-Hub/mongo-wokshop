# MongoDB Replication

Replication in MongoDB is a process of synchronizing data across multiple servers. It ensures high availability, data redundancy, and fault tolerance by maintaining identical copies of the data across a cluster of servers. Replication is the foundation of MongoDB's robust and reliable architecture, particularly in distributed systems.

## 1. What is Replication?

Replication in MongoDB involves creating and maintaining multiple copies of data, known as replica sets. A replica set consists of:

- **Primary**: The node that receives all write operations.
- **Secondary**: Nodes that replicate data from the primary node and can serve read requests if configured.
- **Arbiter**: A node that participates in the election process but does not store data.

## 2. Why Use Replication?

Replication provides:

- 1. **High Availability**: Ensures data accessibility even if the primary node goes down.
- 2. **Fault Tolerance**: Protects against server failures.
- 3. **Read Scalability**: Secondary nodes can handle read requests to distribute the load.
- 4. **Data Durability**: Maintains multiple copies of data to prevent data loss.

## 3. Replica Set Architecture

A MongoDB replica set typically consists of:

- 1. **One Primary Node**: Accepts all write operations. Changes to data are recorded in the oplog (operation log).
- 2. **One or More Secondary Nodes**: Replicate the oplog from the primary and apply the changes to their data set.
- 3. **Optional Arbiter Node**: Helps in elections to select a new primary when needed but does not store data.

## 4. Setting Up a Replica Set

Example Configuration Assume three MongoDB instances running on ports 27017, 27018, and 27019.

Start MongoDB Instances

```bash
mongod --port 27017 --dbpath /data/db1 --replSet myReplicaSet
mongod --port 27018 --dbpath /data/db2 --replSet myReplicaSet
mongod --port 27019 --dbpath /data/db3 --replSet myReplicaSet
```

Initialize the Replica Set

```javascript
rs.initiate({
  _id: "myReplicaSet",
  members: [
    { _id: 0, host: "localhost:27017" },
    { _id: 1, host: "localhost:27018" },
    { _id: 2, host: "localhost:27019" }
  ]
});
```

Check the Replica Set Status

```javascript
rs.status();
```

## 5. Failover and Elections

If the primary node becomes unavailable:

- 1. The secondary nodes automatically initiate an election to choose a new primary.
- 2. The arbiter (if present) participates in the election to help decide the new primary.
- 3. Once the original primary is back online, it rejoins the replica set as a secondary node.

Election Example:

- **Before Failover**: Primary on localhost:27017.
- **During Failover**: Primary node fails; election starts.
- **After Election**: localhost:27018 becomes the new primary.

## 6. Read Preference

MongoDB allows you to control how read operations are distributed across the replica set using read preferences.

**Read Preference Modes**:

- 1. **Primary**: Default mode; all reads go to the primary.
- 2. **PrimaryPreferred**: Reads from primary if available; otherwise, reads from secondary.
- 3. **Secondary**: Reads from secondary nodes only.
- 4. **SecondaryPreferred**: Reads from secondary if available; otherwise, reads from primary.
- 5. **Nearest**: Reads from the node with the lowest latency (primary or secondary).

Example:

```javascript
db.getMongo().setReadPref("secondaryPreferred");
```

## 7. Oplog (Operation Log)

The oplog is a special capped collection (`local.oplog.rs`) that stores a rolling record of all operations that modify data on the primary node. Secondary nodes use the oplog to replicate changes.

**Key Features**:

- 1. Sequential operations recorded in the oplog.
- 2. Secondary nodes apply these operations in the order they were written to the oplog.

## 8. Replica Set Configuration

You can modify the configuration of a replica set dynamically.

**Adding a New Member**

```javascript
rs.add("localhost:27020");
```

**Removing a Member**

```javascript
rs.remove("localhost:27020");
```

**Reconfiguring a Replica Set**

```javascript
cfg = rs.conf();
cfg.members[0].priority = 2; // Increase priority for a specific node
rs.reconfig(cfg);
```

## 9. Replication Caveats

**Write Concern**: Controls the acknowledgment level for write operations.

- `w: 1`: Acknowledgment from the primary node only.
- `w: "majority"`: Acknowledgment from the majority of nodes.

Example:

```javascript
db.collection.insertOne({ name: "Alice" }, { writeConcern: { w: "majority" } });
```

**Replication Lag**: Secondary nodes may lag behind the primary, particularly under heavy write loads.

**Arbiters**: They do not store data, so having too many arbiters can compromise redundancy.

- _HALTED REPLICATION_
- _SIZING THE REPLICATION OPLOG_
- _HEARTBEAT AND FAILOVER_
- _COMMIT AND ROLLBACK_
- _WRITE CONCERNS_
- _JOURNALING_
- _READ SCALING_ (Attempt to read data from secondary replicas)
- _TAGGING_ (connect to specific cluster with tagging) ask gpt for sample code

# Conclusion

MongoDB replication ensures data availability, fault tolerance, and durability. By setting up and managing a replica set, you can handle server failures gracefully, distribute read operations, and maintain a consistent and reliable database infrastructure. Understanding replication concepts and configuration options is crucial for building resilient applications with MongoDB.
